# Development2Development
This TODO is Designed to be update everytime we finished our current development. 
This TODO serves as a guideline on what we should work on the next time we come back to this project's development.
And every time we resume to development, we should read TODO first to know where to start
We follow an append-only strategy in the writing of thie file.
