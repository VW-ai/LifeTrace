# Smart History

This product will track your time. It will tell you where your hours go. It will do this automatically.

## What It Does

Smart History reads your calendar and notes. It finds patterns in how you spend time. It shows you data about your activities over weeks, years, decades.

The system runs daily at 2 AM. It pulls from Notion and Notion Calendar. It saves organized events to a database. You get charts and breakdowns of your time.

## Current Status

**Under Development**

I am building the MVP. The core features work in development. The product is not ready for users.

## Target Users

People who want to understand their time patterns. People who use Notion for planning. People who value data-driven insights about their daily habits.

## Value Proposition

Most people cannot tell you how they spent last month. This product can. It turns scattered calendar entries and notes into clear time reports.
