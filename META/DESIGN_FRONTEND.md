# Frontend Instruction
We will have some specific guideline on how our frontend should be designed.

# Template
There is a template for our frontend in terms of styling and dashboard display at folder `smartHistory/src/frontend/templateLook`. This is a pure frontend template design.
## Notice
Our template design do not follow exactly on how our backend api is designed, but it points at the correct direction on how our frontend should look like.

# TODO
Learn the `templateLook`, adjust/improve/re-implement our frontend please
