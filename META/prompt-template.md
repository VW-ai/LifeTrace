## 🎯 Context
This project is governed by six key meta files that define every aspect of its scope, design, and progress:
1. **PRODUCT.md** – Product vision & scope: core features, use cases, target users, and value proposition.  
2. **DESIGN.md** – Technical blueprint: architecture, file structure, tech stack, APIs, deployment, integration details.  
3. **REGULATION.md** – Development rules: coding standards, naming conventions, version control, testing requirements.  
4. **PROGRESS.md** – Chronological log of milestones, updates, and decisions.  
5. **TODO.md** – Task tracker: actionable items, priorities, and statuses.  
6. **PRODUCT_FUTURE.md** – Long-run features for after the current MVP. These should not affect immediate work unless explicitly mentioned.

## ⚙️ Rule
1. Every new feature or change must update **all relevant META files** for consistency.  
2. Each proposed feature must have its **own markdown file** created under `META/features/`, summarizing:  
   - Feature name  
   - Purpose  
   - Implementation details  
   - Impacted modules/files  
   - Dependencies  
   - Future considerations

## 🧩 Instructions
When I provide the TODO section below:
- **Interpret the request** (whether it’s a new feature, fix, or refactor).  
- **Update the relevant META files** accordingly.  
- **Log the change in PROGRESS.md** with a timestamp and summary.  
- **Add actionable items in TODO.md** with priority labels (e.g., `[High]`, `[Medium]`, `[Low]`).  
- **If this is a new feature**, also create a `META/features/<feature_name>.md` file.
