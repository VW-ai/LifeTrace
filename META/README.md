- TODO.md - Current task tracker
- PRODUCT_FUTURE.md - Long-term feature roadmap
- README.md - Core project overview

### [features/](features/)
Feature-specific documentation for current or active development:
- Tagging system documentation
- Frontend update plans
- Agent design specifications
- Branch-specific META files

### [archive/](archive/)
Completed milestones and historical documentation:

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Core files** should be consulted for any development work
2. **Feature files** are relevant when working on specific features
3. **Archive files** provide historical context but don't affect current work
4. **Proposal files** contain analysis and recommendations for reference

For questions about the META system, always start with `core/META.md`.
