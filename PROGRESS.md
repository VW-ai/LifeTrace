- **Project Setup:** Initialized the project structure and documentation files (`META.md`, `PRODUCT.md`, etc.).
- **Notion API Integration:**
    - Successfully connected to the Notion API.
    - Implemented a script to recursively fetch content from the diary page.
    - Saved the fetched Notion data to `notion_content.json`.
- **Google Calendar API Integration:**
    - Pivoted from Notion Calendar to Google Calendar.
    - Set up OAuth 2.0 credentials and the consent screen.
    - Successfully connected to the Google Calendar API.
    - Implemented a script to fetch calendar events from the last 30 days.
    - Saved the fetched calendar data to `google_calendar_events.json`.
- **Secret Management:** Refactored the secret handling from a plain text file to a more secure `.env` file, ignored by Git.
- **Git Configuration:** Resolved issues with the `.gitignore` file to ensure sensitive files like `token.json` and `credentials.json` are not tracked.

- **Google Calendar Parser Implementation:**
    - Created `src/backend/google_calendar_parser/` directory following atomic file structure principles.
    - Implemented `parser.py` with consistent output format matching notion parser structure.
    - Added time-based filtering using `updated` timestamp with configurable hours threshold.
    - Implemented duration calculation in minutes from start/end times.
    - Added robust error handling for malformed data and missing files.
    - Successfully parsed 1,028 calendar events from sample data.
- **Testing & Documentation:**
    - Created comprehensive test suite with 4 test cases covering filtering, structure, and edge cases.
    - All tests passing with 100% success rate.
    - Added `meta.md` documentation explaining parser purpose, logic, and integration points.
- **Data Processing Results:**
    - Generated `parsed_google_calendar_events.json` with standardized event format.
    - Each event includes: source, event_id, summary, description, duration, timestamps, and links.
    - Output ready for AI agent consumption in next development phase.
