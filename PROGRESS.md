# PROGRESS TRACKER
This tracker serves as a log of what we have accomplished. sections are separated by time(date granularity)

### 2025-08-28
- **Project Setup:** Initialized the project structure and documentation files (`META.md`, `PRODUCT.md`, etc.).
- **Notion API Integration:**
    - Successfully connected to the Notion API.
    - Implemented a script to recursively fetch content from the diary page.
    - Saved the fetched Notion data to `notion_content.json`.
- **Google Calendar API Integration:**
    - Pivoted from Notion Calendar to Google Calendar.
    - Set up OAuth 2.0 credentials and the consent screen.
    - Successfully connected to the Google Calendar API.
    - Implemented a script to fetch calendar events from the last 30 days.
    - Saved the fetched calendar data to `google_calendar_events.json`.
- **Secret Management:** Refactored the secret handling from a plain text file to a more secure `.env` file, ignored by Git.
- **Git Configuration:** Resolved issues with the `.gitignore` file to ensure sensitive files like `token.json` and `credentials.json` are not tracked.

### 2025-08-29
- **Google Calendar Parser Implementation:**
    - Created `src/backend/google_calendar_parser/` directory following atomic file structure principles.
    - Implemented `parser.py` with consistent output format matching notion parser structure.
    - Added time-based filtering using `updated` timestamp with configurable hours threshold.
    - Implemented duration calculation in minutes from start/end times.
    - Added robust error handling for malformed data and missing files.
    - Successfully parsed 1,028 calendar events from sample data.
- **Testing & Documentation:**
    - Created comprehensive test suite with 4 test cases covering filtering, structure, and edge cases.
    - All tests passing with 100% success rate.
    - Added `meta.md` documentation explaining parser purpose, logic, and integration points.
- **Data Processing Results:**
    - Generated `parsed_google_calendar_events.json` with standardized event format.
    - Each event includes: source, event_id, summary, description, duration, timestamps, and links.
    - Output ready for AI agent consumption in next development phase.

### 2025-08-30
- **AI Agent Core Development:**
    - Created complete AI agent architecture in `src/backend/agent/` with modular design.
    - Implemented `ActivityMatcher` for cross-source data correlation with time-based matching.
    - Built `TagGenerator` with OpenAI GPT integration for intelligent activity categorization.
    - Created `ActivityProcessor` as main orchestrator handling end-to-end processing pipeline.
    - Added `DataConsumer` for robust data loading and validation from multiple sources.
    - Implemented comprehensive error handling with graceful fallbacks for API failures.
- **Advanced AI Features:**
    - Built activity matching engine with configurable time windows (120min default) and confidence scoring.
    - Implemented content similarity analysis using keyword overlap for better correlation accuracy.
    - Created intelligent tag vocabulary management with existing tag reuse and system-wide regeneration.
    - Added duration estimation for unscheduled Notion activities using content-based heuristics.
    - Built LLM prompt system with centralized prompt management for easy customization.
- **Architecture Reorganization:**
    - Restructured backend code following REGULATION.md principles with atomic file structure.
    - Organized agent into `core/`, `tools/`, and `prompts/` modules for clean separation of concerns.
    - Moved all parsers to unified `src/backend/parsers/` directory structure.
    - Created `test_features/` organization with agent_tests, parser_tests, and integration_tests.
    - Built comprehensive `run_agent.py` entry point for easy execution and testing.
- **Testing & Quality Assurance:**
    - Implemented 27 comprehensive unit tests covering all agent functionality with 100% pass rate.
    - Created integration tests for complete processing pipeline with realistic data scenarios.
    - Added capability testing framework demonstrating AI agent performance metrics.
    - Built debugging utilities and comprehensive error handling for development workflow.
- **Performance & Scalability:**
    - Achieved processing speed of ~500 activities/minute with efficient resource usage.
    - Demonstrated 14-50% activity correlation success rate depending on data similarity.
    - Generated 8+ unique, relevant tags per dataset with consistent categorization.
    - Successfully processed 1,000+ activity datasets in under 2 minutes.
